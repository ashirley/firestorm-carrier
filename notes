Basics
	

	Frame/chassis
		
		THe vehicle's main chassis is built from 25mm square-section steel tube. This stuff is reasonably expensive from DIY shops but
		we obtained a reasonable quantity for free as they were considered offcuts by the original owners.

	Drive motors
		
		After disappointing experimentation with razor e300 electric scooter motors, the drive system was changed for twin electric
		wheelchair motors. These motors are pre geared, giving the vehicle much more torque, while operating at lower currents and
		prolonging battery life.

	Motor controller

		INitially we were going to build an H-Bridge, but after some costing up we're now using a Sabretooth 2x25 Motor controller.

	Mower Base
	
		WHile the basis for the original project, it's looking more and more like we won't use a lawnmower at all, however see below.
	
	Alternator
	
		Technically optional, should we be considering this a minimum requirement due to the inconvenience of charging the vehicle up 			by other means. Is it possible to use an electric motor for this, and alternatively use it to start the engine..?


Features and ideas


Modules!
	Mule: A simple wheelbarrow like attachment mounted on top of the main deck for transporting tools, rubbish, camping gear, water etc. 
	Research into adding a powered dumper/tipper system underway.

	Umbrella: By adding a semi-permanent upright tube, a parasol/pub umbrella can be added to act as a mobile shelter from the rain or 		sun.

	Jenny (The generator): Adding an inverter will allow us to power 230v stuff on the move, and combined with the alternators will 	 effectively turn the rig into a mobile generator.

	Winston (The server): A most likely RPi based server would allow easy access and control of the various modules and on board systems. 		In future this could include a mobile media server, and be engineered to work in tandem with the other computer based modules and PA.

	Chatterbox: A wireless router - whether this is broadcast by the onboard server as an adapter, or as a separate device, this would 		allow a mobile network to be setup, for whatever purpose. Examples include a mobile wifi hotspot, or a base station for phone based 		communications.

	PA: What it sounds like. A simple mixer, microphone and speakers (powered or with amp). Powered either from the inverter or directly 		somehow. Could take an output from Winston to play music from the server, or possibly act as an airplay speaker.

	


	
	


	
Software:


Self shutdown + one button powerup:
	Use similar system to the tag board. Program wheels to lock beforehand - Done, keyswitch powerup allows removal of activation key so prevent "unauthorized" restart.

Safety cutout relay
	Relay held on by microcontroller - 24v systems can only power up when certain conditions are met. Although at first glance there may be no 		need for this, it is simple enough to implement and gives the option of adding additional safety features later

Emergency stop
	A little costly, but worth doing? A simple big red button on the back of the vehicle, just in case. - Done, ESTOP cuts power to main solenoid and processors, killing the machine instantly.

Control: A web GUI is in the experimental stages to allow us to control the secondary functions of the rig via a laptop/smartphone.
